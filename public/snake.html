## How the Touch Controls Work

I've implemented two different touch control methods to give players options:

### 1. Swipe Controls
- **Swipe in any direction** to change the snake's direction
- The snake will move in the direction of your swipe
- Swipes need to be at least 30 pixels long to register
- Temporary speed boost when swiping (similar to keyboard controls)

### 2. Joystick Controls
- **Use the joystick** in the bottom left corner for more precise control
- The joystick will appear automatically on mobile devices
- Move the joystick in any direction to control the snake
- The snake moves faster while the joystick is active

### Additional Touch Features
- **Tap anywhere** on the game canvas to pause/resume the game
- Visual feedback when touching the screen (ripple effect)
- Instructions displayed at the bottom of the screen
- Larger touch targets for the mute button on mobile devices

### Mobile Optimizations
- The joystick is automatically shown on mobile devices
- Touch controls are disabled when the game is paused or over
- Proper event cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Improved visual feedback for better user experience

These touch controls make the snake game much more playable on mobile devices while maintaining the original gameplay experience.
